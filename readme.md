# [WIP] Extremely simple 3D maze with three.js 

This is currently work in progress. If you want to see it work anyway, just clone/download the project, run ```gulp``` (if you have it installed) and then open the ```index.html```. ES6 prototypal source code available in /src folder.

TODOs:
  - Better mouse control
  - Collision detection
  - Textures
  - Generate maps + import from JSON
